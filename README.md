Machine Learning Projects:
This projects developed when I was learning ML models. Here I did Linear Reression, Polinomial Regression and Logistic Regression, KNN-Logistic Regression models.

Installation
All these projects are developed on Jupyter Notebook. If you would like to set up these projects on your own machine, its requaire python packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy and some others. 

Usage
The projects provide how to get insights and how they pro-processed for machine learning models, how they split for test and train data, and how biases managed. How to interpre the results is showed in the end with final models.


Data
Each of datasets used in these projects provided within each folder. Linear Regression and Polinomial models used @advertising dataset with which kind of advertisement affected the most on sales and another one is CO2 Emission dataset which include
has what kind of cars affect less than other to reduce Carbon Emission. There are Logistic Regression models uses popular education datasets which are: @iris, @diabetes, @hearing_test, @raisin_datasets to provide better insights from teh datasets. 


Models
The models trained in these projects are: LinearRegression, Polinomial and Logistic Regression including the data cleaning, hyperparameters and other training techniques including scaling, cross-validation, gridsearch, pipelines and bias-visualization.

Results
The results of the projects summarised with evaluation metrics depending on the if data trained with supervised learning it uses RootMeanSquareError, MAE, MSE, R2 scores or if its unsupervised learning uses Accuracy, Precision, F1_score and Recall scores.

Future Work
These projects are aviable for to train new datasets on these models. 

Contributing
If anyone would like to contribute these projects they would freely use all the projects or insights to develop own models.

Credits
All the datasets are publicly aviable datasets on kaggle, for me they provided by @techproeducation institution during my bootcame education.

Acknowledgments
I wanna say thank for my tutors and my colleges who studies Data-Sciense bootcamp on @techproeducation and my colleges in masters program in Neuroscience department of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun in Poland.

Feel free to customize this template to fit the specific needs of your project. Good luck with your Machine Learning project!
